# Split & Merge Image Segmentation

Split & Merge Segmentation is a *region-based* image segmentation technique that combines both top-down and bottom-up approaches. The process consists in recursively splitting an image into four smaller regions based on a homogeneity criterion. Then, adjacent regions are merged to form larger homogeneous regions, resulting in the final segmented image.

This project was done as a final assignment for the Signals, Images and Videos course held by professor Rosani at the University of Trento. Read the notebook `report.ipynb` to learn more about the algorithm.
